# GameDev_Unity
Unity engine game development projects.

All projects where inclass assignments.<br>
#### Project 1: 
Create objects in Unity and run using c# script - get to know unity assignment
#### Project 2: 
parent child relationship simulation outside unity's development platform. The relationship is setup in C# and is managed by the code and not unity.
#### Project 3:
Vector graphics simulation. Using vectors simulate shooting balls trajectory (line equation) create shadows (projection equation)
#### Project 4: 
Simulate hierarchy using custom shaders. A custom shador was implemented to create a hierarchy of objects with a pivot implementation.
#### Project 5: 
Implement modeling engine and texture mapping engine. The plane is created from vectors and triangle. Its normal is calculated for texture mapping and an a user interface is created to manipulate the texture poistion, rotation and scaling factor. The second part of the assignment involved rotating the plane to create a spherical object whose vertices can be transformed via handle created.
Project 5 is a two team assignment. Team members: Sharanya Sudhakar and Naomi Fidlekorn
